# My awesome config

**WARNING:** This config looks nice when you run it but it is an abomination, may god have mercy on your soul if you have to debug this.

All of the configuration is in rc.lua and theme.lua has the colors. Some names for the colors make no sense so just change them and see what works.
You might also need to change some .svg files to make them the color you want. You can use the `fill=` attribute.

You will need to build the rust projects under `rust_projects/` to run this config.
